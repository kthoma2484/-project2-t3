# -project2-t3

Da-Ta-Baby is a name finding app that uses the name data from two sources (noted below)to find random, origin based, and common US names. The app works by providing options for how users want to search - random search, origin based search, or search among common US names dating back to the year 1880. 

Once an option is selected, the user enters or selects as prompted by the search criteria. The app will alert if fields are missing or unselected and request that user enter appropriate selection/input fields.

Once the input fields have valid data, the app will search and present the data.
